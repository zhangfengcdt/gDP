gDP
===

This is a generic dynamic programming algorithm framework.

Dynamic program algorithm solves discrete-time optimal-control problems using Bellman's rule. The framework is implemented such that the user only needs to provide the objective function and the model equations. The function includes several options for solving optimal-control problems. 


About 
--------------

Dynamic programming algorithms are used for optimization (for example, finding the shortest path between two points, or the fastest way to multiply many matrices). A dynamic programming algorithm will examine all possible ways to solve the problem and will pick the best solution. 

Therefore, we can roughly think of dynamic programming as an intelligent, brute-force method that enables us to go through all possible solutions to pick the best one. If the scope of the problem is such that going through all possible solutions is possible and fast enough, dynamic programming guarantees finding the optimal solution. 

The alternatives are many, such as using a greedy algorithm, which picks the best possible choice "at any possible branch in the road". While a greedy algorithm does not guarantee the optimal solution, it is faster. Fortunately, some greedy algorithms (such as minimum spanning trees) are proven to lead to the optimal solution.
